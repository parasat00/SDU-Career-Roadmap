\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}
%these sections are optional, up-to the author
\section{Motivation}
Inter-University career roadmap - Our main idea is to create an easy and simple service for teaching different programming languages, libraries, frameworks and individual services related to programming in SDU.
\section{Aims and Objectives}
What are our goals?
1. Create a simple learning center
2. Make it easy and convenient to use
3. Create a “Career roadmap” path for the app.
4. Set up and create good learning systems
I think points 3 and 4 are the most difficult. For their full creation, you need a lot of knowledge and work.
The direction of research is, of course, teaching and web programming.
\section{Thesis Outline}
The first chapter is \nameref{ch:intro} chapter. It is this one that you are currently reading. It gives insight into the work done. In Chapter \ref{ch:A} we review related work and formulate the problem to solve. Chapter \ref{ch:B} is describing the solution to the problem. And in \nameref{ch:concl} chapter we conclude our conclusion.
